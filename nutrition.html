					<p>I suppose that in a literal sense, it is true that you are what you eat. Our bodies are composed primarily of the food and drinks we put in our mouths, plus some things like oxygen that we draw from the air, nutrients like vitamin D that we make with the help of sunlight, and bacteria that enter from the environment. In this literal sense we are what we eat, but why are we so concerned with what we put in our mouths? Can eating certain foods make us healthier and better individuals as well? Or, is food selection more like fashion, or perhaps even like religion?</p>

					<p>What is hot? Styles of restaurants, types of cookbooks, and weight loss diets change in predictable ways that are very reminiscent of changes in clothing fashions, home furnishings, and even hairstyles. Don't you think you can look at the clothing and grooming of a young couple in New York or San Francisco entering a fashionable restaurant and be able to predict what they are likely to be eating?</p>

					<p>The amazing finding was that the diet did make a difference. Although the details are complex, I interpret the findings as providing good evidence that adopting a diet tilted toward the Mediterranean one very possibly will make you healthier in a relatively short period of time than would continuing to eat bacon cheeseburgers with Coke and pastries. Although this may not sound shocking, the study is among the first providing convincing evidence that you can directly alter your health by deciding to change what you put in your mouth.</p>
